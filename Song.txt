"Rise"

All I see is shattered pieces
I can't keep it hidden like a secret
I can't look away!
From all this pain in the world we made!

Every day you need a bulletproof vest
To save yourself from what you could never guess!
Am I safe today?
When I step outside in the wars we wage!

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown!

Sound it off, this is the call!
Rise in revolution!
It's our time to change it all
Rise in revolution!
Unite and fight, to make a better life!
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call, tonight we rise!

Rise
Tonight we rise
Rise
Tonight we rise!

Like a hand grenade thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos, trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone!
Faster than the blast of a car bomb!

And when the scars heal, the pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes!
Darkness fades away!
And the light shines on a brave new day!

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown!
